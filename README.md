## Angular Assignment

1. I created an Angular application for admin management.<br>
a. I implemented Login for both user and admin<br>
i. User login could only see his details.<br>
ii. The Admin does everything.<br>
b. I implemented CRUD operations. E.g., created user, deleted user, displayed user, and updated user.<br>
c. I created a report of activities by admin.<br>
d. I faked the services with hard-coded data.<br>
e. I used observable and reactive forms<br>

### N:B: The first account that is registered will be assigned to the Admin and all other accounts are assigned to the regular User. Admins have access to the admin section and can manage all accounts, but regular user accounts can only update their own profile.


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
